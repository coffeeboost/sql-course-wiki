What are Relational Database Management Systems?
A Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is a type of database management system that is used to organize and manage data in a structured way. It is called "relational" because it stores data in tables that are related to each other based on common attributes or keys.
The RDBMS is made up of several components, including the database engine, which is responsible for processing and storing data, and the Structured Query Language (SQL), which is used to retrieve and manipulate data. The RDBMS also includes tools for managing the database, such as backup and recovery tools, security features, and transaction management.
One of the key advantages of an RDBMS is its ability to enforce data integrity and ensure consistency across different tables. For example, it can enforce referential integrity, which means that if a record in one table is deleted, any related records in other tables are also deleted or updated accordingly.
Overall, the RDBMS is a powerful tool for managing and organizing large amounts of structured data, and it is widely used in many industries, including finance, healthcare, and e-commerce.
