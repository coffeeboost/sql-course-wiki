Functionality of RDBMS
A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a powerful tool for organizing and managing large amounts of data in a structured and efficient way. Here are some things that you can do with an RDBMS:
Create and manage databases: With an RDBMS, you can create databases that are designed to store and organize data in a structured way. You can define tables, columns, and relationships between tables, and ensure that the data is consistent, accurate, and secure.
Store and retrieve data: You can use an RDBMS to store and retrieve data from the database. You can use Structured Query Language (SQL) to perform queries, insert, update and delete data, and manage the relationships between tables.
Manage transactions: RDBMS can help you manage transactions, which are sequences of database operations that need to be performed as a single unit of work. Transactions ensure that the database remains consistent and accurate, even when multiple users are accessing and modifying the data at the same time.
Ensure data integrity: RDBMS can enforce data integrity by ensuring that the data is accurate, consistent, and secure. This includes enforcing referential integrity, which ensures that data in related tables is consistent, and constraints, which ensure that the data meets certain rules and requirements.
Provide backup and recovery: RDBMS can provide backup and recovery capabilities, which ensure that the data is safe and can be recovered in case of data loss or system failures.
Overall, an RDBMS is a powerful tool for managing and organizing large amounts of structured data. It provides a range of features and capabilities that help ensure data consistency, accuracy, and security. Understanding how to use and manage RDBMS is an essential skill for many computer science professionals.
