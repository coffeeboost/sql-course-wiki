What is a Query?

Used the “briefly summarise” intent

In SQL, a query is a command that is used to retrieve data from a database. A SQL query typically consists of a SELECT statement, which specifies the columns of data to retrieve, and a FROM statement, which specifies the table or tables to retrieve the data from. Queries can also include other statements to filter, sort, and aggregate the data.
