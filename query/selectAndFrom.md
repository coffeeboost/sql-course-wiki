SELECT and FROM Function

The SELECT function in SQL is used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database. It is one of the most important SQL commands, and is used extensively in applications that involve managing and manipulating large amounts of data.
The SELECT statement typically includes the following elements:
The SELECT keyword, which indicates that a query is being made to select data from one or more tables.
A list of columns or expressions that should be returned in the query results.
The FROM keyword, which specifies the table or tables that the data should be retrieved from.
Here is a simple example of a SELECT statement:
```
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
```
In this example, the SELECT statement is selecting the columns "column1" and "column2" from the table "table_name". The result of the query will be a set of rows containing the data from those two columns.
WHERE Function
The WHERE function in SQL is used to filter the data in a SELECT statement based on one or more conditions. It allows you to specify criteria that must be met in order for a row to be included in the result set.
The WHERE clause is typically included after the FROM clause in a SELECT statement, and it contains one or more conditions that must be met. The conditions can include comparisons, such as equals (=), not equals (<>), less than (<), greater than (>), less than or equal to (<=), or greater than or equal to (>=). The conditions can also include logical operators, such as AND, OR, and NOT, which allow you to combine multiple conditions.
Here is an example of a SELECT statement that includes a WHERE clause:
```
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE column1 > 5
```
In this example, the SELECT statement is selecting the columns "column1" and "column2" from the table "table_name", but only for rows where "column1" is greater than 5.
You can also use the WHERE clause to filter the data based on multiple conditions. Here is an example of a SELECT statement that includes multiple conditions in the WHERE clause:
```
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE column1 > 5 AND column2 = 'some_value'
```
In this example, the SELECT statement is selecting the columns "column1" and "column2" from the table "table_name", but only for rows where "column1" is greater than 5 and "column2" is equal to 'some_value'.
Overall, the WHERE clause is a powerful tool that allows you to filter the data in a SELECT statement based on one or more conditions. It is a fundamental part of SQL, and is used extensively in applications that manage and manipulate large amounts of data.
